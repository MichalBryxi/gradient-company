## Motivation

1. Over time I collected a lot of stories from my IT friends. Jokes from the environment of big corporates and/or startups. I thought that it would be neat to collect them as a comic. Unfortunately I haven't found easy way to create and download for publishing my ideas (for free). So why not create your own?
1. This is a simple example of React in action - a learning project.
1. I wanted to create first ever comics that accepts pull requests. See a spelling error? Want to address discriminative language? Have idea for new episode? Raise a PR!
1. Also this was not obvious from the start, but I'm creating first ever fully accessible comics. It is possible to do virtually infinite zoom without losing quality. Also text readers works very well. And there is possibility to enable high contrast mode as well.

## Technicalities 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
